This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Also used:

* Typescript
* Firebase db
* Chakra UI
* Formik
* Fetch API
* API Routes

## Before Getting Started

You need to signup for an api key at [`https://serpapi.com/`](https://serpapi.com/) since the app is used this service to search google scholar articles.

## Getting Started

First, intall packages:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
